# Fitness-Tracker-Website

Fit-Track Pro is a comprehensive, user-friendly health and fitness tracking application designed to support individuals in achieving and maintaining their wellness goals. Developed as part of an Agile Software Engineering project, the application integrates various health management components — including physical activity tracking, meal logging, workout calorie burner, and progress visualization — into a single, seamless platform.
The system architecture incorporates a responsive ReactJS frontend, a secure and scalable Python (Flask) backend, and a MySQL database for robust data management. Users can create personal profiles, log their fitness activities, monitor their daily nutritional intake, and visualize progress through intuitive dashboards. Additional features such as weekly/monthly health summaries can enhance the app's usability and effectiveness.
Unlike traditional fitness apps that focus on isolated features, Fit-Track Pro emphasizes holistic health management by combining multiple aspects of personal fitness into one synchronized tool. The application’s agile development methodology ensures iterative improvement, user feedback integration, and modular design. This approach not only enhances the system’s scalability and maintainability but also ensures a high degree of user engagement.
With privacy-focused design and future-ready capabilities such as wearable integration and AI-driven suggestions, Fit-Track Pro is well-positioned as a modern fitness companion, tailored to meet the dynamic needs of university students and general users alike. Our further plan includes adding a LLM by connecting google/gemma-2b-it downloaded from hugging face and running it locally using “transformers accelerate” to our website for smart feedback and responses.

Requirements and Feasibility Study The application requires:
•	Frontend: ReactJS-compatible device+HTML/CSS (modern browser)
•	Backend: Flask along with SQL Integration, LLM Integration
•	Database: SQL-compatible engine (MySQL)

Methodology

The Fit-Track Pro system involves multiple user roles interacting seamlessly through a health and fitness management platform. Primary users include individual users (students, fitness enthusiasts, or health-conscious individuals) who use the system to track their workouts, monitor calorie intake and burn, measure diet,workout and visualize overall progress. Users interact via a responsive front-end built using ReactJS, while the backend logic and API endpoints are powered by Flask.
The system is backed by a MySQL database for storing user credentials, fitness logs, health metrics, and feedback data. The application follows an Agile methodology, with iterative development cycles and continuous user feedback to improve features such as physical activity monitoring, daily goals, and personalized insights.
Administrators and developers manage the application via secure backend access to ensure data integrity, system reliability, and periodic updates. The system supports modular enhancements, allowing easy integration of wearable devices or machine learning-based health suggestions in future versions. Progress tracking and feedback are visualized using interactive charts powered by Chart.js or Plotly, enabling users to make informed health decisions and maintain a consistent fitness routine.

Conclusion 
				
Fit-Track Pro stands as a successful outcome of our Agile Software Engineering project, embodying the principles of iterative development, user-centered design, and seamless technology integration. By combining a modern ReactJS frontend with a Flask backend and MySQL database, the system delivers a comprehensive and responsive platform for health and fitness tracking. The project showcases novelty not just in its technical architecture, but in its approach to personalized wellness management, offering real-time activity tracking, meal logging, LLM for smart responses and progress visualization in a single application.
While the application meets core functionality goals, limitations such as data accuracy, personalization depth, and integration complexity remain areas for future work. Nevertheless, the iterative Agile approach has laid a strong foundation for continuous improvement. Future development phases can extend Fit-Track Pro’s utility through features like telehealth integration, AI-based health recommendations, and adaptive user interfaces.
Overall, Fit-Track Pro exemplifies how Agile methodologies can drive innovation in health tech, producing a scalable and user-friendly solution that supports individuals on their fitness journeys.
